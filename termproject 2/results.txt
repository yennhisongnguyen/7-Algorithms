2. Is this project complete?
    Almost, the only problem is that for any of the string sorts the array size can only go up to 30,000 maximum. Otherwise
    there will be a segfault.
3. Which sort would you use for integer and 4. Which sort would you use for string?
    We both agree that for integer it would be better to use radix/bucket sort, since you will ever only have 9 buckets
    maximum. Whereas, for strings you would need 26-52 buckets depending on whether uppercase letters are being taken into
    account, so it's not as easy to implement even though it is the fastest.
    So for strings we would choose heap sort instead of radix/bucket sort. Since it's second fastest.
4. We did not do any of the bonus for integers
